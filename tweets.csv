"""1.   During COVID outbreak, our facility has been withholding N95 masks for aerosolizing procedures and advising to only use a surgical masks. 2.   It was disseminated that we may utilize our own medical grade N95 masks from home. However, when we brought this equipment in to utilize, we were told these masks were to be only single use, despite the current shortage.  The inability to provide appropriate protective equipment as advised by the following collaborative statement. Employees who have continued to wear their N95 masks have been facing disciplinary action.  The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF), and American Academy of Anesthesiologist Assistants (AAAA) believe that the safety of anesthesia professionals is of utmost importance in developing policies related to personal protective equipment (PPE). Due to close patient contact and the need for airway instrumentation, anesthesia professionals are at increased risk of exposure and infection for all diagnostic, therapeutic, and surgical procedures during this rapidly escalating COVID pandemic in the U.S.  Growing experience has shown that there can be a 5-day or longer incubation time between exposure to the COVID virus and development of symptoms and that there are individuals who are COVID-positive who are either asymptomatic or who have minimal symptoms. Laboratory testing for coronavirus is not universally and promptly available. As a result, identification of who is COVID positive or negative with certainty is not possible in the setting of clinical care. Therefore, we recommend as optimal practice that all anesthesia professionals should utilize PPE appropriate for aerosol-generating procedures for all patients when working near the airway.  3.   Ideally, anesthesia professionals should use properly fitted N95 masks or powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs). For those who are not N95 fit-tested, have facial hair, or fail N95 fit-testing, PAPRs should be used if possible. Surgical face masks protect against COVID-19 droplet transmission but do not protect against aerosolized small particles. The CDC has developed a detailed table (reference 2) that describes surgical facemask, N95 mask, and PAPR use, based upon distance from a patient with suspected or known COVID-19 and the use of source control (i.e., masking of symptomatic patients).4.   Issuance of N95 masks or availability of PAPRs for all clinical anesthesia personnel should be a priority. If a facility has existing or projected shortages of N95 masks or PAPRs, however, temporary mitigation plans based on current CDC recommendations should be enacted. These plans should include facility and case-by-case reviews of the potential of patients and procedures to generate aerosolized particles, as well as assessments of respiratory pathogen characteristics (e.g., routes of transmission, community spread, prevalence of disease in the region, infection attack rate, and severity of illness) and local conditions (e.g., number of disposable N95 mask available, current respirator usage rate, and success of other PPE conservation strategies). 5.   Healthcare facilities may wish to implement extended use and/or limited reuse practices before shortages are observed so that adequate supplies are available during times of peak need and demand. Extended use and/or limited reuse of N95 masks should follow CDC (reference 4) and institutional guidelines.6.   All components of appropriate PPE should be carefully addressed. For aerosol-generating procedures this includes eye protection (goggles or a disposable face shield that covers the front and sides of the face), a gown, and gloves, in addition to airway protection with N95 masks or PAPRs (reference 1). 7.   Effective hand hygiene before putting on and after removing PPE, including gloves, is very important.8.   Procedures for proper donning and doffing, disposal of contaminated PPE, and cleaning of contaminated reusable PPE and anesthesia equipment should be established following CDC and institutional recommendations.9.   The CDC recommends a combination of approaches to conserve supplies while safeguarding health care workers and when there are existing or projected shortages of N95 masks: Implement engineering and administrative controls to minimize the number of individuals who need to use respiratory protection.  Where feasible, use alternatives to N95 masks (e.g., other classes of filtering face piece masks, face piece air purifying respirators, and PAPRs). For more details on these respirators, see CDC's ""A Guide to Air-Purifying Respirators?(https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2018-176/default.html).10.   Implement practices allowing extended use and/or limited reuse of N95 masks.11.   Prioritize the use of N95 masks for those personnel at highest risk of COVID-19 exposure and/or those anesthesia professionals in high risk categories (e.g., those with prior health conditions, older age).12.   Masks approved by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) typically used in the construction and manufacturing industries, but not currently meeting the Food and Drug Administration?s (FDA?s) requirements may be effective in protecting health care personnel from airborne exposure, including COVID-19.References:1.

It is now May 6th and the only precaution they have taken its to shut down operations starting tonight, until 9 AM the following morning on the seventh. With a cleaning crew to allegedly sterilize the facilities.  With the way the virus behaves, I don't see how shutting down for a single night after being potentially exposed for a whole week will solve anything and in my opinion has put a large amount of employees at risk.

I understand the nessessity of plasma donation in this time but do not understand with as many people as we have out sick and not tested.  As well as how many people have been in direct contact with those who are being quarantined.

On top of our 5 nurses unable to work in the center if it's safe to stay open at this time and to borrow from our Fort Wayne Cold Water center and chance that nurse getting infected?

This is not only the employee safety but the safety of the donor who after donating plasma have lowered their immune system for the next 24 hours until their body can produce the plasma that they donated."" - 1450 Getz Road, FORT in Fort Wayne, IN",C-1571363

Other:
Employees that can reasonably work from home and have demonstrated that ability over the past weeks of the stay at home order are no longer being given the option to do so as of 5/4/2020. Even employees that are considered high risk are being pressured to work in the office. Many managers would rather have their employees working from home but are not allowed to do so. Guidance has been given to all managers to force working in the office even when not necessary and to pressure high-risk employees to follow suit by forcing them to plead their case to their human resources representative. This is communicated as being attributed to any perceived loss of productivity and therefore additional costs due to working from home must be avoided. Even though this loss in productivity has not been documented over the past several weeks. Myself, as well as many employees, have no actual need to be in the office environment other than to attend in-person meetings. These meetings are no longer being allowed due to social distancing requirements. So there is in fact zero actual need for many employees to physically be in the office. Most of the building is set up with cubicles with very little physical separation between employees. I along with many others fear that any introduction of the virus would spread very rapidly in this environment and many are being unnecessarily put at risk. Below is a verbatim communication sent to managers, record of which I can provide, describing what is to be communicated to employees concerned about their health and safety. |||To Fort Wayne Managers:  | |We wanted to provide you with some additional talking points concerning our decisions to return to on-site operations for the Corporate office on May 4th:| |Governor Holcomb mentioned that those who can work from home should, or should be encouraged to do so. Should my employees work from home?| |The leadership team believes that it is important for our headquarters to return to on-site operations May 4th, as planned. We understand the reasons for the Governor's recommendation, as he is assessing risks across a wide variety of work environments, with many more unknowns than we are assessing as we consider the safety of our employees at our headquarters facility. We continue to believe that our headquarters is a safe working environment, and have taken additional steps to increase social distancing and hygiene measures.| |My employees have been meeting my expectations in their remote work. Why is it necessary that they change that in the face of continued uncertainty?| |As you know, our organization is facing difficult revenue challenges in the second quarter and will continue to face these challenges in the third quarter and beyond.   As you also know, we are taking measures to ensure our short-term and long-term success, including significant actions to reduce fixed costs. It is critical that we strive to achieve every efficiency and productivity advantage possible to meet the needs of our customers and avoid the need for further fixed cost actions.  Our customers and our 5,500 global employees rely on our support on a daily basis, as well as to create and implement strategic plans for the entire organization.  Our Headquarters team is critical to the operating success of our Company.| |Is there anything I can do to ensure that my employees feel safe and comfortable returning to work?| |We understand that some of our employees are anxious about returning to the office. We encourage managers to continue to require social distancing (including modeling appropriate behavior) and emphasize the hygiene guidance we have provided in previous messages.

On March 12, 2020, a patient was discharged and returned to a skilled nursing facility (""SNF"").
Upon arrival at the SNF, the patient began manifesting high fever and symptoms of pneumonia.
The SNF returned the patient to test for COVID-19 and before he could return to the SNF.
He was taken back to the Emergency Department and waited there while maintenance was busy attempting with the HVAC to get negative. There are concerns that the patient waited for up to four hours in a general area.  Emergency staff transported him in to the elevator and brought him to the Second Floor Telemetry and brought him into a negative pressure room they set up for him.
Nurses were given personal protective equipment, booties, hair net, face shield and N-95.  
There was no suit on the floor. Nursing staff must go through the supply room to gain access to it.

"""Coworker has tested positive for COVID-19 and continues to report to work and/or family member of a coworker has tested positive for COVID-19 and the coworker continues to report to workI come to work at 5:30 in the morning. The facility is set so that I have to call and have someone let me in. After I am let in, they are to take my temperature and I am to fill out a sign-in form. However, for whatever reason, some times the phone is not answered, and I've even been encouraged to just open the automatic door myself and then proceed to take my own temperature. No witness, and not done by a registered nurse. Even then, a good number of the thermometers present appear to not work as intended, said by other staff as well. I fear that people will come in the building on their own accord, and give themselves a temperature check, but could possibly lie on the forms as to whether they have a fever or not. Since there's no witness, there's no way to say these filings are incorrect. I've always searched for a nurse to give me an accurate temperature reading. Others might not feel so inclined to do so. My other complaint concerns isolation units. A unit was put under isolation at 7 in the morning. Being a dietary employee, I brought them a room tray cart. This was at 7:45 a.m.. It wasn't until 9 a.m. that i was informed that the unit was in isolation. While I was standing in the middle of said unit. I asked repeatedly why I wasn't informed about this so I could put all of the residents on throw-aways such as Styrofoam cups and foam-hinged plates. The only answer I received was ""it just happened this morning."" I believe they should have told the dietary staff (who doesn't have face shields and protective gowns) as soon as they knew the unit would be closed off. Once on throw-aways, they still tried to return the items to us. To which i said ""i cannot take that to the kitchen. It has to be disposed of on the unit."" I've said this repeatedly. Dietary has now made the conscious decision to place the entire facility on disposable items like plastic silverware, Styrofoam cups, etc.. Something I feel should've been done from the beginning had the higher management been truthful with us about the severity of the Covid-19 situation. My final complaint is that the Covid-19 came from coworkers. Some who have worked despite having a high temperature. From what I was told, they were told to leave shortly after, but nevertheless, we have had two positive cases of the virus in residents. Since family members cannot enter the facility at this moment, and residents are told to stay in their rooms, the only logical explanation is that the residents received the virus from an employee. Hence why we now have two isolation units. I do not feel as though enough is being done to handle the situation, and i feel as though important information is not being told to all staff in the facility.The part of the facility that i am employed in is skilled care. With three different hall; long-term care (100 hall), a dementia ward (200 hall), and a rehabilitation unit (300 hall). The isolation hall was 200 hall. Since the incident, i have not been inside of the locked unit. Only to bring and receive a cart that i then bleach and disinfect in case anything hazardous is on the cart. Another isolation hall is 300 hall because the back has been turned into a Covid-19 unit or a ""400 hall"" as said by my executive director. I've seen nurses however not wearing the protective gowns in the hall, and handle my cart without gloves. 100 hall is currently not under isolation, but considering we've had, unfortunately, three deaths between Saturday and Sunday in between a time of 24 hours, they too are on foam plates and whatnot for the same reason; the safety of the residents, and the safety of the dietary staff."" - Westside Village Health Center in Indianapolis, IN",C-1577591

"""Health care professionals at SSM Health St. Mary?s Hospital in St. Louis, MO are allegedly exposed to the following hazards: 1.Nurses, Respiratory Therapists, and CNAs are treating patients in COVID-19 Units one shift and then transferred to other departments to treat patients in Non-COVID-19 departments during following shifts; thus exposing staff and patients to the virus in the Non-COVID-19 units. Most concerning is when they have to provide medical treatment to the NICU and ICU departments and are not permitted to wear PPE to protect medical staff and patients from virus exposure knowing they could be carriers. It is poor infection control practice to have staff assigned to COVID-19 departments who are then crossing over to work in other specialty care departments. 2.There are at least three Respiratory Therapists working St. Mary?s that have tested positive for COVID- 19 with additional tests results pending. Each and every staff member in the various departments where these respiratory therapists have been assigned over the past one-two weeks has been exposed to the virus since these respiratory therapists have been seen working without any PPE after they have treated patients who have died from the coronavirus. Medical staff are permitted to continue to work once symptoms appear after exposures therefore exposing nearly everyone they come in contact with. 3.Medical staff are storing their respirators in brown paper bags between each use. Staff are concerned that they cannot insert and remove the PPE and guarantee the contaminated exterior of the facepiece doesn?t contaminate the interior of the paper bag and then transfer back to the interior of the respirator. We suggest management put paint on the exterior of the respirator and then put it in an out of a paper bag numerous times and see where the paint spreads to ? how can this be done to prevent the interior contamination? Recommend training workers on how to do this. 4.It does not appear that OSHA is investigating the death of PII, SSM Health St. Mary?s Hospital nurse who was the first St. Louis COVID-19 death. She contracted the virus when traveling on business to Indiana for a conference. 5.Nurses are not permitted to wear N95 masks/respiratory protection voluntarily when purchased with their own money to protect themselves and others. Since a nurse with 32 years of experience quit, the hospital has permitted staff to wear cloth masks; however, these masks are inadequate to prevent the spread of the virus. If nurses have adequate PPE (purchased on their own to avoid depleting the hospital?s supply), they should be permitted to wear the appropriate respiratory protection and not have to settle for an inadequate cloth masks. Wearing cloth masks donated by the community potentially exposes the staff to the virus since the hospital can?t ensure the masks have been sanitized properly after donation. Additionally, if someone wears a mask that does not protect the user from the virus then they have a false sense of security and could lead to inadvertent exposure and additional transmission of the virus. 6.Nurses, Respiratory Therapists, and CNAs are not provided the same level of protection that doctors are allowed.

UCI Health is requiring Registered Nurses to observe droplet precautions with a surgical mask and face shield, instead of the state mandated airborne precautions when caring for suspect and confirmed COVID-19 patients. Appropriate respirator PPEs are being denied to registered nurses by management, since it falls outside of current infection prevention protocol of the medical center, in violation of the ATD mandate. -Under UCI Health?s ?Working Well Policy,? medical center staff are being instructed to ?not wear masks if you are asymptomatic,? even if an COVID-19 exposure may have occurred. Staff exposure risk at UCI Health is higher, due to UCI Health?s failure to comply with ATD mandates. In addition, if staff are afebrile, but have respiratory symptoms, staff are being directed to only wear a surgical mask and return to work. Due to the shortage of appropriate isolation treatment spaces, there is also an increased risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other respiratory acquired communicable illnesses, outside of physical treatment spaces. Medical center managers are stopping, questioning, and counseling staff on staff against use of surgical masks, requesting staff remove their surgical masks unless they are providing direct patient care to a suspected/confirmed COVID-19 patient. UCI Health currently educates medical center staff that ?you are NOT exposed if you are wearing required PPE during care,? yet UCI Heath is not in compliance with what ATD considers required PPE. -Medical staff are instructed that mandatory mask re-use is in effect. UCI Health?s current implementation of mandatory respirator re-use is also in violation of the ATD. Current UCI Health policy requires re-use of respiratory masks across COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 populations. The medical center currently deems it appropriate for a healthcare provider to use the same respiratory mask for care of a COVID-19 patient and a tuberculosis patient, contradicting recommendations of public health agencies and ATD mandates. Inpatient nursing units and anesthesia are being instructed by medical center management to preserve respiratory masks by placing a surgical mask over them. There has been no training provided to UCI Health staff to ensure mandatory respirator re-use is being appropriately followed, and in compliance with Cal OSHA ATD mandates. -Cal OSHA compliant PPEs are not readily available to medical center staff providing treatment to patients. Patient care and physician orders are being delayed in execution, due to the prolonged time it can take to obtain appropriate PPE from medical center management. PPE provided by management in these cases are inadequate and do not meet the Cal OSHA requirements set forth in the ATD, when conducting all ATD deemed aerosolized procedures, including but not limited to nebulized breathing treatments.

"""job while we were actively working instead of shutting down operation. If these people coming here were unable to pass through a terminal at the airport due to public health & safety, why is it okay they come to our job without prior warning or even without being given the same precautionary measures. Our Hub Manager was given no prior notice about this even happening. He found out by seeing Hazmat employees cleaning in our warehouse & within this conversation with some of the workers he was then informed on why they were there & given some minor details. This was 3 days before the people being quarantined were set to arrive. Initially employees of Cargo Force were told that these people would be in our area while no one was working & that we?d have nothing to worry about. But in all actuality they were there while operation was in motion. Employees were insisted to work. The people arrived at our job Friday 02/07/2020 around 5:30PM/6PM & didn?t leave until 10:30PM/11PM & our shift starts at 11PM. This was not handled appropriately or with any regard to employees health or safety. If this has been declared a National Health Emergency then why is this not being taken seriously? The health care professionals who performed these quarantine exams at our job did not dispose of the hazardous materials properly i.e. rubber gloves, facial masks, thermometer & thermometer covers etc. These hazardous materials were put in a basic black trash bag & disposed of outside of our job in the dumpster. The incubation period for this coronavirus is 2-14 days & you can pass the virus without even having symptoms yourself. There was no informed consent. Employees were blindsided & left in the dark on so many details we have a right to know. Please take this complaint seriously. As am I. With so many unknowns about this virus it is crucial that I as a mother take this seriously as I have children I have to come home to & ! risk not only myself but them being exposed to this virus that people are losing their lives to. I myself did not work Friday night when the quarantines were there due to me taken precautions & I feel it is unjust not only for employees to be exposed to this health threat without informed consent but for the ones who chose not to risk it & not show for work that night lose pay. Hazardous pay should be put in place. Our health & safety should be a priority. This whole ordeal was not handled properly & at the employees expense."" - Cargo Force, Inc. in Omaha, NE",C-1542889
